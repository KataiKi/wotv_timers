# WotV Timers
Adds various timers on /r/wotv_ffbe banner for the GL Server.

## Description
This script will add timers to the /r/wotv_ffbe banner, helping you keep track of routine refreshes that happen across the game.  The timers include:

* World Time (Pacific Time)
* Time Until Daily Reset
* Time Until Shop Reset
* Time Until Normal Summon Reset
* Time Until Guild Battle Starts/End
* Daily Bonuses for Chambers

The script does not account for cancelations due to maitenance, and does not track anything related to events.

Timers will also highlight Red if a timer is 30 minutes from triggering, and will highlight Green for 30 minutes after it triggers.
